[Editing clock string]

For the clock string, you can use these things:

%day
%monthname
%month
%year
%hour12 (time format 12)
%hour
%min
%sec
%ampm
%batpercent
%batlifehour (battery life hour)
%batlifemin (battery life minutes)

If you want to show the percent symbol you have to write '%%'.
To make a new line, write '\'.
